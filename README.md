# Project Title: Employee Feedback project in node.js server with Devops Testing
This project involves creating a Node.js server to handle two roles: Admin and Employee. Employees can submit feedback to the Admin, while the Admin can assign tasks to individual Employees. Each Employee can view their assigned tasks and feedback. The Admin can manage tasks and view feedback. The backend will be containerized using Docker, creating a Docker image for deployment on AWS. A CI/CD pipeline will be implemented to automate the build, testing, and deployment process for seamless operations.
